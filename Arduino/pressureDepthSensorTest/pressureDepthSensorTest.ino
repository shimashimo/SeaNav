// Pressure Sensor test code 8/9/22 Haoyu (Leo) Wang, revised by Diane Brancazio dianeb@mit.edu
// last rev 4/7/22
// This code is used to test Adafruit Pressure+Temperature sensor on the LPS35HW breakout board
// Overview of the product at https://learn.adafruit.com/lps35hw-water-resistant-pressure-sensor
// You will need to install the Adafruit LPS35HW Library and the Adafruit BusIO library 
// using the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.
// This program reads in the pressure and converts it to depth underwater in cm or ft.
// The conversion equation comes from the Hydrostatic Water Pressure Formula P = ⍴gh (⍴ is the greek letter rho, lowercase)
//   P is the pressure of a fluid at a depth in water. Sensor unit is hectoPascals which is 100 Pascals
//   ⍴ is the density of the fluid (997.05 kg/m^3 for freshwater, and 1023.6 kg/m^3 for saltwater)(, and h is the column of water above
//   g is the acceleration of gravity (9.807 m/s^2)
//   h is the height of the fluid column (in meters)
// Solving for h, the equation is h = P/(⍴g).  For the sensor unit of hPa and output of cm, it is h = (P/(⍴g))/10000
// Calculated through, it is h = P / 0.9778 (freshwater),and h = P / 1.0038 (saltwater).  Units are meters.
// these values are set as constants - choose the appropriate one for your code
// For accurate readings of depth underwater, submerge the sensor at the very top of the water and hit Reset on the Arduino 
// TO calibrate the robot or a measuring tape to the top of the water, use the variable "depthOffset" currently set to -10

//Connections and wiring notes for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Logic
//Vin - power in from Arduino - connect to 5V (3.3V is ok too)
//GND - connect to Ground from Arduino
//SCK - SPI Clock pin, connect to pin 13
//SDO (MISO) - Serial Data Out / Microcontroller In Sensor Out pin, connect to pin 12
//SDI (MOSI) - Serial Data In / Microcontroller Out Sensor In pin, connect to pin 11
//CS - Chip Select pin, drop it low to start an SPI transaction, connect to pin 10

//Connections and wiring notes for I2C interface, with discrete wires (or the easy way -
// using a JST-SH 4-pin connector to the STEMMA QT header on the board)
//Vin (Red wire on JST-SH) - power in from Arduino - connect to 5V (3.3V is ok too)
//GND (Black wire on JST-SH) - Ground from Arduino - connect to GND
//SCK (Yellow wire on JST-SH) - the I2C clock pin, connect to A5 or SCL (near AREF)
//SDI (Blue wire on JST-SH) - the I2C data pin, connect to A4 or SDA (near AREF)
//SDO and CS pins are not needed in I2C protocol
